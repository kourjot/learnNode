🔹 Difference Between HTTP and WebSocket:

Feature	HTTP (Request-Response)	WebSocket (Full-Duplex)
Communication Type	One-way	Two-way (client ↔ server)
Connection	Short-lived	Persistent (open rehta hai)
Real-Time Support	❌ Not real-time	✅ Real-time data exchange
Usage	Static websites, APIs	Chat apps, live notifications, games


🔹 WebSocket Flow:
Handshake – Client ek WebSocket request bhejta hai (ws:// ya wss://)

Connection Established – Server accept karta hai

Data Exchange – Dono taraf se real-time messages exchange hote hain

Connection Close – Jab kaam ho jata hai, connection band hota hai
